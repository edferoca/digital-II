Mapping design into LUTs...
Writing file top_map.ngm...
Running directed packing...
ERROR:Pack:2811 - Directed packing was unable to obey the user design
   constraints (LOC=D18) which requires the combination of the symbols listed
   below to be packed into a single IOB33 component.

   The directed pack was not possible because: More than one pad symbol.
   The symbols involved are:
   	BUF symbol "rst_lcd_OBUF" (Output Signal = rst_lcd)
   	PAD symbol "rst_lcd" (Pad Signal = rst_lcd)
   	PAD symbol "lcd_spi_mosi" (Pad Signal = lcd_spi_mosi)

Mapping completed.
See MAP report file "top_map.mrp" for details.
Problem encountered during the packing phase.
